## 📖 Introduction

​	As a STEM blogger, the most painful part of every post is dealing with equations. WeChat’s built-in editor doesn’t speak LaTeX, screenshots look blurry, and third-party plugins love to garble the layout. Sometimes I burn half an hour just to place a simple $E = mc^2$.

​	That’s why so many of my earlier articles were just PNGs: I’d write the note in LaTeX, snap a screenshot, and paste it into the post.

​	After road-testing every tool on the market, I found the same rule: the good ones are pricey, the cheap ones are clunky, and the setup overhead is ridiculous. Since nothing felt right, **I built my own**—WeChat Formula Styler (SVG standalone edition)--**WeFormula-v1.0**.
